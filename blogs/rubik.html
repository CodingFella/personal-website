        <p>Sometimes, when you run, you might be inclined to put on music 
            from your favorite artists or with a higher beats per minute (BPM) to motivate you to run faster or more efficiently, 
            but does it really help?</p>

        <h2>Gathering Data</h2>
        <p>My running data was gathered from Strava and my music data was gathered from Spotify. 
            I used each application’s respective data takeout service to gather my lifelong data 
            on each platform. The running data was in the form of <code>.fit</code> files, which is standard 
            for Garmin devices, which was the brand of the watch I used to record my runs, and 
            the music data was nicely packaged into <code>.json</code> files.</p>

        <h2>Cleaning Up Data</h2>
        <p>The only data I needed were songs that were being listened to during a running activity. Since 
            I also use Spotify outside of running, there are many songs that are not important. Using Python, 
            I iterated through the songs in the <code>.json</code> files until its time stamp landed in a running 
            activity. Since songs are shorter than running activities, I chose to iterate through each song 
            to wait until it hit a running activity, then loop and record each song’s data until it reached 
            the end of the running activity and repeat. I placed the data I thought would be useful into a 
            csv text file. Below is the driver function to convert the data into a csv file.</p>
