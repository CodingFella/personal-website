        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, when you run, you might be inclined to put on music 
            from your favorite artists or with a higher beats per minute (BPM) to motivate you to run faster or more efficiently, 
            but does it really help?</p>

        <h2>Gathering Data</h2>
        <p>My running data was gathered from Strava and my music data was gathered from Spotify. 
            I used each application’s respective data takeout service to gather my lifelong data 
            on each platform. The running data was in the form of <code>.fit</code> files, which is standard 
            for Garmin devices, which was the brand of the watch I used to record my runs, and 
            the music data was nicely packaged into <code>.json</code> files.</p>

        <h2>Cleaning Up Data</h2>
        <p>The only data I needed were songs that were being listened to during a running activity. Since 
            I also use Spotify outside of running, there are many songs that are not important. Using Python, 
            I iterated through the songs in the <code>.json</code> files until its time stamp landed in a running 
            activity. Since songs are shorter than running activities, I chose to iterate through each song 
            to wait until it hit a running activity, then loop and record each song’s data until it reached 
            the end of the running activity and repeat. I placed the data I thought would be useful into a 
            csv text file. Below is the driver function to convert the data into a csv file.</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="python">def compute():
    musicmanager = MusicManager()
    activitymanager = ActivityManager("activities_txt_form")
    num_activities = 853
    for i in range(num_activities):
        activity_start_time = activitymanager.getStartTime()
        activity_end_time = activitymanager.getEndTime()
        activity_avg_pace = activitymanager.getAveragePaceFromSpeedField()
        activity_sport = activitymanager.getSportType()

        if(activity_sport == "Run"):
            song_start_time = musicmanager.getCurrentStartTime()
            song_end_time = musicmanager.getCurrentEndTime()

        while(song_end_time < activity_start_time):
            if(musicmanager.nextSong()):
                song_start_time = musicmanager.getCurrentStartTime()
                song_end_time = musicmanager.getCurrentEndTime()
            else:
                break

        while(song_start_time < activity_end_time):
            avg_pace_during_song = activitymanager.getAveragePaceBetweenTimes(song_start_time, song_end_time)
            distance_during_song = activitymanager.getDistanceBetweenTimes(song_start_time, song_end_time)

            # make sure duration_played is more than 30 seconds (30000)
            duration_played = musicmanager.getDurationPlayed()
            threshold_ms = 30000

            if(avg_pace_during_song != -1 and musicmanager.getTrackName() != None 
                and musicmanager.getArtistName() != None and duration_played > threshold_ms):

                data_str = (musicmanager.getTrackName() + "|" + 
                            musicmanager.getArtistName() + "|" + 
                            str(avg_pace_during_song) + "|" + 
                            str(activity_avg_pace) + "|" + 
                            str(distance_during_song) + "|" + 
                            str(musicmanager.getMsPlayed()) + "|" +

                with open("output.txt", "a") as file:
                    file.write(data_str + '\n')

            if(musicmanager.nextSong()):
                song_start_time = musicmanager.getCurrentStartTime()
                song_end_time = musicmanager.getCurrentEndTime()

        <h2>Analyzing Data</h2>
        <p>In total, there were 4268 data points, meaning I listened to a total of 4268 songs while running. 
            Each field had 7 attributes: the song’s name, the artist’s name, the average pace (m/s) while 
            listening to the song, the average pace (m/s) of the whole run that it took place in, the distance 
            traveled (m), the duration of the song played (ms), and the activity’s file name. Some fields were 
            for the sake of making sure my data was accurate. Some ways I made sure that all the data was relevant 
            would be that I would ensure that the track was playing for a minimum of 30 seconds and I would go and 
            check each activity’s respective post on Strava to see if the paces were relatively lined up.</p>
        
        <p>On Excel, I put some formulas to work. Using the average pace (m/s) while listening to the song (songAverage) 
            and the average pace (m/s) of the whole run that it took place in (wholeAverage), I took the percent difference to 
            see how much faster I was running during each song. </p>
        
        
        <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\text{percent&space;difference}=\frac{\text{songAverage}-\text{wholeAverage}}{\text{wholeAverage}}">
            
        <p>From there, I averaged the perecent difference based on the artist’s 
            name. From there, I found the Z-score of each artist to see if there was a statistically significant difference. 
            Using an alpha level of 0.05, the critical Z-value would be &plusmn;1.96, so anything beyond that would be statistically 
            significant.</p>
        
        <h4>Correlation with Artist</h4>
        <p>Looking at the data with listening to artists that have been played more than 20 times, here are the results:</p>

        <p>Since none of the Z-scores are beyond the critical Z-value of &plusmn;1.96, there is no correlation between pace
            and artist.
        </p>

        <h4>Correlation with BPM</h4>
        <p>However, one could argue that artists have a combination of slow and fast songs, which will make the correlation
            appear diluted. As a result, I decided to investigate to see if the song's BPM would affect my pace. To put this to the test, 
            I took every song and counted how many times I listened to each song, and if I listened to it 5 or more times, I kept it. 
            Then, I plotted the average percent difference on the y axis and its BPM on the x axis. The scatterplot’s trendline had an 
            R&sup2; value of 0.0114, meaning there is little to no correlation between the two axes.

        <p>Visually speaking, there is no trend, and that is backed up by the low R&sup2; value.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>While there is no statistically significant trend with listening to a specific artist or listening to tracks with a certain BPM, 
            listening to music does help with making runs go by faster by letting me take my mind off of running. Nonetheless, while music 
            does not affect my running, the most important step is still just going outside and keeping my body healthy.</p>
