        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
        <!-- body text -->

        <p>Hello! I'm Jacob Lin, a Computer Science and Engineering student studying at Santa Clara University. With a passion for software engineering, I have dedicated my time in university to study and add to my knowledge of coding and all things computer.</p>

        <h2>Skills and Expertise</h2>

        <p>Throughout my career, I have developed a wide range of skills, like multiple languages such as Python, Java, C, C++, and Javascript. Iâ€™ve also been exposed to multiple types of technologies like Xcode and git.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>When I'm not working, I enjoy playing the violin, doing all things triathlon (swimming, biking, and running), and crocheting. Whether it's playing music, exercising, or stitching up cute plushies, I always make time for the things that bring me joy.</p>

        <h2>Contact Information</h2>
        <p>Feel free to reach out to me at jacob.shalom.lin@gmail.com. I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you'd like to work together or learn more about my work, please reach out to me!</p>
